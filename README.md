## My Personal Website

This is my personal website built with **Next.js** and **React Three Fiber**, allowing me to create interactive 3D experiences directly in the browser. It leverages **@react-three/drei** for useful 3D helpers, **@react-three/postprocessing** for visual effects, and **tailwindcss** for styling. The website is designed to showcase projects, experiments, and creative web interactions using modern web technologies.
